-- Migration date: 2026-04-27

-- Move storage_path and pdf_storage_path from documents to document_versions.
--
-- Rationale: there were two sources of truth for "where the bytes live"
--  - documents.{storage_path, pdf_storage_path}    (set on initial upload)
--  - document_versions.storage_path                (set on each new version)
-- New-version uploads only updated the latter, so /display, downloads,
-- and assistant context all drifted to the original upload's bytes.
--
-- After this migration:
--  - document_versions owns storage_path and pdf_storage_path.
--  - documents.current_version_id is the only "which version is live" pointer.
--  - documents.{storage_path, pdf_storage_path} are dropped.

-- 1. Add pdf_storage_path to document_versions.
alter table public.document_versions
    add column if not exists pdf_storage_path text;

-- 2. Backfill: ensure every document has at least one document_versions row
--    (the original upload). Older docs may predate document_versions entirely.
insert into public.document_versions (
    document_id,
    storage_path,
    pdf_storage_path,
    source,
    version_number,
    display_name,
    created_at
)
select
    d.id,
    d.storage_path,
    d.pdf_storage_path,
    'upload',
    1,
    d.filename,
    d.created_at
from public.documents d
left join public.document_versions dv
    on dv.document_id = d.id and dv.source = 'upload'
where dv.id is null
  and d.storage_path is not null;

-- 3. Backfill pdf_storage_path onto the existing 'upload' rows for docs
--    that already had one but predate document_versions.pdf_storage_path.
update public.document_versions dv
set pdf_storage_path = d.pdf_storage_path
from public.documents d
where dv.document_id = d.id
  and dv.source = 'upload'
  and dv.pdf_storage_path is null
  and d.pdf_storage_path is not null;

-- 4. Backfill current_version_id for any document missing one — point it
--    at the most recent version (assistant_edit / user_upload preferred,
--    else the upload row).
update public.documents d
set current_version_id = sub.id
from (
    select distinct on (document_id) id, document_id
    from public.document_versions
    order by document_id,
        case source
            when 'assistant_edit' then 1
            when 'user_upload'    then 2
            when 'user_accept'    then 3
            when 'user_reject'    then 4
            when 'generated'      then 5
            when 'upload'         then 6
            else 7
        end,
        version_number desc nulls last,
        created_at desc
) sub
where d.id = sub.document_id
  and d.current_version_id is null;

-- 5. Drop the columns from documents.
alter table public.documents drop column if exists storage_path;
alter table public.documents drop column if exists pdf_storage_path;
